1. Daily Workflow: The "Cycle of Sales"To keep your data accurate, follow this standard operational loop:Morning Audit: Open the Dashboard (index.html). Check the Low Stock Alerts to see what needs to be ordered from suppliers. Check the Top Debtors to see who needs a follow-up call for payment.Active Sales: Use the POS Terminal (pos.html). When you complete a sale, the system automatically:Deducts the items from your Inventory.Adds the money to your Daily Revenue.Records a log in the Recent Transactions.Restocking: When new goods arrive, go to Inventory (inventory.html). Increase the quantity of existing items or add new ones. Ensure you enter the Cost Price (CP) so your Inventory Value on the dashboard remains accurate.2. Managing the Dashboard MetricsThe Dashboard is your "Flight Deck." Here is what the numbers mean:MetricCalculation LogicBusiness MeaningDaily RevenueSum of all sales where date == todayHow much cash/credit moved through the till today.Inventory ValueSum of (Qty * Cost Price) for all itemsYour "frozen" cash. How much money is sitting on your shelves.Low Stock AlertItems where Qty <= 5Critical warning. You are at risk of losing sales due to out-of-stock.Top DebtorsCustomers with balance > 0Money you have earned but haven't received yet.3. Critical Technical NotesData Storage: All business data is stored in your Browser's Local Storage. This means if you clear your browser history/cache, you will lose your data.Multi-Tab Sync: If you have the Dashboard open in one tab and the POS in another, the Dashboard will update automatically the moment a sale is made thanks to the storage event listener in your nav.js.The Bridge (nav.js): Do not delete this file. It is the "glue" that allows the pages to talk to each other and ensures the navigation bar appears on every page.4. Best Practices for GrowthConsistent Naming: When adding stock, use consistent names (e.g., "Soda 500ml" vs "500ml Soda") to ensure the Top 5 Best Sellers logic groups them correctly.Regular Backups: Since this is a browser-based tool, I recommend manually copying the "Value" of the myInventory and salesHistory keys from your Browser's Developer Tools (F12 > Application > Local Storage) once a week as a backup.
